    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>For the first milestone of this game, I developed the room transitions, most of the door mechanics, and helped with general debugging across tasks that my teammates worked on.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>For the alpha version of the game, I implemented the bomb, boomerang for the player, the 2D bow room, pushable blocks, and fixed most of the bugs before getting it ready for the submission.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>For the final gold build of the game, I handled the polishing and fixing of most of the original mechanics as well as implementing the smashable blocks and designing some of the rooms in the latter half of the alternate dungeon. I also assisted in modifications to the dash functionality to help ensure that it was interesting while also being fun to use.</p>
