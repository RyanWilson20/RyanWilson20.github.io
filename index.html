        <li>
            <p>The web build sometimes loads with the resolution screwed up on certain screen resolutions. It fixes if you zoom out then zoom back in the webpage.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>For the first milestone of this game, I developed the room transitions, most of the door mechanics, and helped with general debugging across tasks that my teammates worked on.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>For the alpha version of the game, I implemented the bomb, boomerang for the player, the 2D bow room, pushable blocks, and fixed most of the bugs before getting it ready for the submission.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>For the final gold build of the game, I handled the polishing and fixing of most of the original mechanics as well as implementing the smashable blocks and designing some of the rooms in the latter half of the alternate dungeon. I also assisted in modifications to the dash functionality to help ensure that it was interesting while also being fun to use.</p>

            <p>A 2D puzzle platformer game that the player must use a grappling hook to navigate rooms. I developed the game by myself over the course of 2 weeks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Buttons: Square buttons stay down when pressed while round buttons need to be held down and trigger doors or fields</p>
            <p>Jump Pads: Launch the player upwards when touched</p>
            <p>Fields: Cause the player's hook to disconnect when they are passed through</p>
